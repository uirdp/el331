In 1977, Konishi moved from Japan to Peru to work with another chef, Nobu Matsuhisa, who is now known for his Nobu fusion restaurants in Peru, the United States, and other countries.[3] Konishi worked and operated a Lima restaurant called Matsuei, one of the first in the city to specialize in Japanese food, for ten years.[1][3] He then opened two additional Japanese eateries, Toshiro's and Wako, which were located in Lima's Sheraton hotel.[3]

Konishi was an early pioneer of Peruvian Fusion cuisine, which mixes Japanese and Peruvian culinary traditions.[3] He was a regular participant in international food festivals.[3] He also taught at Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola in Lima.[3] He opened Mesa 18 at the Miraflores Hotel in Lima in 2013, and the Oishii, his most recent restaurant, in 2015.[2][4]

In 2008, the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries awarded him the Minister's Prize. Konishi was the first Japanese chef based in Latin America to receive the award from the ministry.[3]

Konishi died from cancer on April 17, 2016, at the age of 63.[1] His wife and daughter have since taken over the Toshiro brand.
